# Ricochet
A simple game for iOS, still needs some finishing touches before release. Made with Brandon Tai (https://github.com/Brandon-Tai)

It's like a single-player Pong with fun added physics and other features. You have to keep the ball on screen as long as you can. There is also a level editor included. All UI is done in code using Spritekit and physics are handmade, so the source comes it at a few dozen kb.
